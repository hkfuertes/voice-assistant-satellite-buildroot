	  Automatically expand root filesystem to fill entire SD card
	  on first boot.
	  
	  This package uses sfdisk to expand the root partition and
	  resize2fs to expand the ext4 filesystem. The process happens
	  in two phases with an automatic reboot in between:
	  
	  Boot 1: Expand partition, reboot
	  Boot 2: Expand filesystem, complete
	  
	  After expansion, /RESIZED flag prevents re-execution.
	  
	  Required tools:
	  - sfdisk (from util-linux)
	  - resize2fs (from e2fsprogs)
	  
	  The root partition will use all available space on the SD card.
